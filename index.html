    <h3>Ido-Linguo.org</h3>
    <p>Ido is an artificial language that was created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds. It was meant to be as easy to learn as possible, and be grammatically, orthographically, and lexicographically consistent and regular.</p>
    <p>Because there are not many resources available for the language, I hoped to promote its use by helping there be a more easily available resource center it. It is harshly incomplete, and I haven't worked on it for some time, but I still love the idea :)</p>
    <p>You can visit it <a href="ido-linguo.org">here</a> if you wish.</p>

    <h3>Christiansen Fasteners website</h3>
    <p>Contracted to redo their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140124012347/http://christiansenfasteners.com/">previous website</a>, Jesse Smick and I completed this <a href="http://www.christiansenfasteners.com/">new website</a> for them</p>
    <p>We are capable of making mobile-friendly and responsible websites, but were not paid to in this example. I suspect that if we were contacted, we would be willing to make more for more people :)</p>
