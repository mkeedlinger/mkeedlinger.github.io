<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>In 2013, there was a special training broadcast regarding the hastening of the work of salvation. This included training for leaders and members as member missionaries.</p>
<p>Please go to this site for inspiration on how to follow the prophet&#39;s guidance: <a href="https://www.lds.org/training/wwlt/2013/hastening/members-and-missionaries?lang=eng">https://www.lds.org/training/wwlt/2013/hastening/members-and-missionaries?lang=eng</a></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="new-member-retention-efforts">New Member Retention Efforts</h3>
<p>The following are important ideas and activities for the ward council to focus on with recent converts or newly reactivated members. </p>
<ul>
<li>Baptisms for the dead</li>
<li>Speak in sacrament meeting</li>
<li>Receive priesthood</li>
<li>Patriarchal blessing</li>
<li>Receive a calling</li>
<li>Be assigned a home/visiting teaching companion</li>
<li>Be assigned a home/visiting teacher</li>
<li>Family history</li>
<li>Get them attending Gospel Principles class</li>
<li>Teach New Member lessons. Focus on having members (primarily Ward missionaries) teach the lessons more after baptism (slowly switching from full-time missionaries teaching to members teaching as lessons go forward)</li>
</ul>
<p>The New and Returning Member Progress Form helps you keep track of a recent convert&#39;s progress: <a href="https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/wwlt/hasten/PD50020824-member-progress-form-eng.pdf?lang=eng">https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/wwlt/hasten/PD50020824-member-progress-form-eng.pdf?lang=eng</a></p>
<h3 id="progress-record">Progress Record</h3>
<p>The Progress Record is an online way to see the progress of those people the full-time missionaries are working with. It is also very helpful for coordination because the missionaries can add notes into the &quot;Help Needed&quot; section that the ward council can assist with.</p>
<p>It is helpful for all ward council members to look over the progress record <em>at least weekly</em>. Doing this will help the ward council know who is being worked with and make sure the full-time missionaries (including senior couples) haven&#39;t forgotten to make a return appointment with anyone.</p>
<p>This also allows all members of the council to bring inspired input to ward council meetings.</p>
<p>How to get there:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to <a href="https://www.lds.org/mls/mbr/">https://www.lds.org/mls/mbr/</a></li>
<li>sign in with your LDS account</li>
<li>find the &quot;other&quot; button</li>
<li>click &quot;progress record&quot;</li>
<li>you may also want to click the <code>X</code> on the 2 week filter so you can see who we&#39;ve worked with in a longer time period</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you can see previous appointments, fellowshippers that are involved, and when investigators haven&#39;t attended sacrament meeting recently (only full-time missionaries can enter this in and WMLs should report this to them).</p>
<h3 id="ward-boundary-survey">Ward Boundary Survey</h3>
<p>Sometimes it may seem that there is no missionary work to do in your ward, but there <strong>always</strong> is; we just need to find it. The following method has proved to be successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a portion of the houses in the ward to each member of the ward council and/or ward missionaries</li>
<li>Go to <em>every</em> home in the ward and find out who lives there (you may already think you know who lives there, but things change, and someone may be renting their basement unnoticed. Be thorough with this search!)</li>
<li>Identify:<ul>
<li>Non-members</li>
<li>Less-active members</li>
<li>Members without their records in the ward</li>
<li>Anyone else who could benefit from being taught by missionaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure to report on your findings and coordinate your work</li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, the Bishop can help the ward mission leader identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Men who haven&#39;t received the priesthood (or need to be advanced in the priesthood)</li>
<li>Unendowed members</li>
<li>Those who could be sealed</li>
<li>Those with expired temple recommends</li>
<li>Those without a patriarchal blessing</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a list of those who you could potentially work with, prayerfully select those that you feel inspired to begin working with, and act.</p>
<p><em>note: This survey should be repeated every six months</em></p>
<h4 id="how-to-contact">How to Contact</h4>
<p>When looking for the people above, it is important to not be invasive or intrusive. There are ways to find out who is in your ward without offending. Here are some ideas, but, as always, follow the Spirit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk with active ward members who live nearby to find out who may live in a home you are less familiar with.</li>
<li>Be neighborly and friendly. Show a genuine interest in those who live there and a desire to fellowship with them.</li>
<li>Consider expanding the survey to meet neighborhood emergency preparedness goals by identifying how many children, elderly, and those who require daily life-saving medicines live in each home. This information can be used to insure everyone in the ward boundaries are accounted for and cared for in case of an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ward-mission-leader">Ward Mission Leader</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Ward Mission Leader, under the direction of the Bishop, leads the missionary work in his Ward. This section specifically addresses their role in the work.</p>
<h3 id="ward-missionaries">Ward Missionaries</h3>
<p>Have at least three ward missionaries besides yourself (six is recommended). This is important, even if there doesn&#39;t seem to be much work in your ward currently. The Lord will only send work to those who are prepared and ready. If you have less ward missionaries, council with your bishop and request more be called.</p>
<p>Having more ward missionaries ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is someone who is trained and prepared to go on visits with the full-time missionaries</li>
<li>That at least one of the ward missionaries&#39; schedules will allow them to attend appointments</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ward-missionary-training">Ward Missionary Training</h3>
<p>Training is extremely important, and will increase your effectiveness as a ward missionary. Here are some of the things that you should do to train yourself and your ward missionaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and study from <a href="https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/36617_eng.pdf?lang=eng">PMG (Preach My Gospel)</a>, especially chapters 2-6, and 9-13</li>
<li>Study the scriptures cited in PMG and think of how to apply them to those you teach</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/the-work-of-salvation-in-the-ward-and-stake?lang=eng">chapter 5 in Handbook 2: Administering the Church</a></li>
<li>Read <em>Ward Mission Leader, See Yourself in the Work</em>: <a href="https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/wwlt/hasten/hastening-the-work-ward-mission-leader-eng.pdf?lang=eng">https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/wwlt/hasten/hastening-the-work-ward-mission-leader-eng.pdf?lang=eng</a></li>

<h3 id="dinner-appointments-for-young-full-time-missionaries">Dinner Appointments for Young Full-Time Missionaries</h3>
<p>The senior missionaries are typically in charge of assigning weeks for each ward in the stake they cover. Dinner appointments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are from <em>Tuesday through Sunday</em> for your ward&#39;s week</li>
<li><em>Must</em> be from 5pm to 6pm</li>
<li>Must have someone at least 18 years old and of the same gender as the full-time missionaries present</li>
<li>Are a <strong>finding opportunity</strong>, and should be assigned to families that could use a visit from the missionaries, such as:<ul>
<li>Part-member families</li>
<li>Less-active homes</li>
<li>Homes with those aspiring to be missionaries</li>
<li>Should be emailed to the young full-time missionaries with the family&#39;s names (including their first names just in case there are other families with the same last name), anything the young full-time missionaries should know about them, and their phone number and address <em>if it is not correct in LDS Tools</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="convert-baptisms">Convert Baptisms</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete the program (often by coordinating with full-time missionaries and those being baptized). This includes (generally in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is conducting (typically the WML)</li>
<li>Who is presiding (a member of the bishopric)</li>
<li>Pianist</li>
<li>Opening hymn</li>
<li>Opening prayer</li>
<li>Talk on baptism</li>
<li>Talk on the Holy Ghost</li>
<li>The baptism (including the name of the person performing the ordinance)</li>
<li>Message on the Restoration (this is specific to convert baptisms, and is done by the full-time missionaries while those who participated in the baptism are changing)</li>
<li>Closing hymn</li>
<li>Closing prayer</li>
<li>When/where/who will be performing the confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: the confirmation for convert baptisms is at the next sacrament meeting and <strong>never</strong> directly after the baptism</em></p>
</li>
<li>Fill the font (which usually takes 2 hours)</li>
<li>Schedule the baptism time with the building coordinator</li>
<li>Conduct at the baptism</li>
<li>Coordinate with the bishop to have a member of the bishopric preside</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng#20.3.4">Handbook 2: Baptismal Services (20.3.4)</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="coordination">Coordination</h3>
<p>WMLs stay in close communication with the full-time missionaries. A coordination email thread helps the missionaries track what is happening in your ward. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject of the email thread should be consistent. This makes it possible to easily search for and find these emails. Here is the suggested format; <em>please follow it exactly</em>, so they will sort appropriately and be easily searchable.<ul>
<li>Format: &quot;<code>[your ward in caps and abbreviated]</code> WML <code>[month]</code> <code>[year]</code>&quot;
<em>note: ask the full-time missionaries what the abbreviation they use for your Ward is.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new email thread should be started every month by the WML, with no additional replies to previous threads.</li>
<li>As coordination continues, keep all emails in the same monthly thread (by simply responding in the thread every time you send an email).</li>
<li>Star, flag, or otherwise mark the email thread so that you can return to it quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>While email is the best primary method of coordination, texting or calling is useful for urgent matters. The WML should also initiate a <strong>weekly phone call or in-person meeting</strong> with the full-time missionaries. A FaceTime or Skype call can sometimes be in place of an in-person visit if you are unusually busy.</p>
<h3 id="fellowshipping">Fellowshipping</h3>
<p>It is very important that there be a fellowshipper at every teaching appointment. It is almost always better to have one. After full-time missionaries make appointments in your ward, they will email (or text) you about it. The WML should then find a ward missionary (or other ward member) that is best suited for the person being taught and commit them to going with the full-time missionaries.</p>
<p>Once you have found someone and committed them to coming, make sure that the full-time missionaries know who it is and their contact info.</p>
<p><em>note: full-time missionaries need someone who is of the same sex and at least 18 years old present.</em></p>
<h3 id="splits">Splits</h3>
<p>Splits are when each of the full-time missionaries goes with a Ward member to different appointments at the same time. During these times, they need someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is of the same gender as the missionaries</li>
<li>Is at least 18 years old</li>
<li>Holds the Melchizedek priesthood (not necessary for Sister missionaries)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also times the full-time missionaries may need to do splits for special circumstances, such as one of them being sick. For these occasions when they must spontaneously do splits, it is very helpful to have a &quot;splits calendar&quot;. This consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of at least 5 strong members that the young full-time missionaries could do splits with, including:<ul>
<li>Their names</li>
<li>Their cell phone numbers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A list of people that the young full-time missionaries can do splits with when one of them is sick. People who typically can help are:<ul>
<li>Those who work from home</li>
<li>Older couples</li>
<li>Those who are retired</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to get a diversity of schedules so there is the highest chance of someone being available.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-things-to-know">Miscellaneous Things to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you are released as the WML, please let the full-time missionaries know, and please send them the name and cell phone number of the new WML.</li>
<li>The full-time missionaries need to know if those who are being worked with (investigator or less-active) are at sacrament meeting <strong>each Sunday</strong>. Please report this in the coordination email thread each Sunday evening <em>before 8pm</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="inspirational-quotes">Inspirational Quotes</h1>
<p>The importance of missionary work has been made clear in the scriptures and by our modern-day prophets. Please prayerfully read and ponder these quotes and apply them to yourselves and your resolve to be a missionary. And please always remember, 1 Nephi 3:5.</p>
<ol>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After all that has been said, the greatest and most important duty is to preach the gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph Smith</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>For thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel 34:11-12</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Peter said for the third time, “Lord, … thou knowest that I love thee.” To which Jesus responded (and here again I acknowledge my nonscriptural elaboration), perhaps saying something like: “Then Peter, why are you here? Why are we back on this same shore, by these same nets, having this same conversation? Wasn’t it obvious then and isn’t it obvious now that if I want fish, I can get fish? What I need, Peter, are disciples--and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world. So, Peter, for the second and presumably the last time, I am asking you to <em>leave all this and to go teach and testify, labor and serve loyally</em> until the day in which they will do to you exactly what they did to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 Nephi 28:21</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those who need our attention, our encouragement, our comfort, our support, our kindness. Be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers.  We are the lords hands here upon the earth with a mandate to serve and to lift his children.  He is dependent upon each of us!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I pray that wherever we are and whatever duties we have in the priesthood of God, we will be united in the cause to bring the gospel to all the world.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>We are all in this together. With fellow ward members and missionaries, we plan and pray and help one another. Please keep the full-time missionaries in your thoughts and prayers. Trust them with your family and friends. The Lord trusts them and has called them to teach and bless those who seek him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If enduring to the end is essential to eternal life, why do we struggle to be faithful? We struggle when we are caught between competing priorities. Casual obedience and lukewarm commitment weaken faith. Enduring to the end requires total commitment to the Savior and to our covenants...Once we enter into covenants with God, there is no going back. Giving in, giving up, and giving out are not options. In the kingdom of God, there is a standard of excellence for exaltation. It requires valiant discipleship! There is no room for average or complacent disciples. Average is the enemy of excellence, and average commitment will prevent you from enduring to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Kevin W. Pearson</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>How seriously have you personally taken the Lord&#39;s charge to share His gospel? It is a lifelong responsibility...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob 1:19</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>President John Taylor warned us, “If you do not magnify your callings, God will hold you responsible for those whom you might have saved had you done your duty.” And who of us can afford to be responsible for the delay of eternal life of a human soul? If great joy is the reward of saving one soul, then how terrible must be the remorse of those whose timid efforts have allowed a child of God to go unwarned or unaided so that he has to wait till a dependable servant of God comes along.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>As the Lord communicates with the meek and submissive, fewer decibels are required, and more nuances are received. Even the most meek, like Moses (see Num. 12:3), learn overwhelming things they &quot;never had supposed.&quot; (Moses 1:10.) But it is only the meek mind which can be so shown and so stretched. Spiritual submissiveness means we then <strong>spend much less time deciding, and much more time serving</strong>; otherwise, the more hesitation, the less inspiration. Yielding one’s heart to God signals the last stage in our spiritual development. Only then are we beginning to be fully useful to God! How can we sincerely pray to be an instrument in His hands if the instrument seeks to do the instructing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Learning by faith requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception. It is in the sincerity and consistency of our faith-inspired <strong>action</strong> that we indicate to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, our willingness to learn and receive instruction from the Holy  Ghost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Wishing will <em>not</em> make it so. The Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. He expects our labors. He expects our testimonies. He expects our <strong>devotion</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson</p>
